===

## Learning Objectives
* Students will learn about the binary search tree data structure
* Students will be able to implement a binary search tree

## Readings
* Read [BST wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree)

## Outline

### What is a Binary Search Tree?
Binary search trees, often referred to as a "BST", are a type of data structure where:
* the left subtree of a node only includes corresponding nodes with keys lesser than the nodes key
* the right subtree of a node only includes nodes with keys greater than the nodes key
* the left and right subtree must also be a BST
* there can be no duplicate nodes
